## E-commerce product page

An e-commerce product page made using Vuejs and Bootstrap

Hosted the page on Render: https://product-page-an5n.onrender.com

Really looked like a simple project when I started it but it challenged me to work with the cart functionality (increasing and decreasing the amount of items in the cart and also using the add to cart button). I then implemented the use of the localStorage function in order to store the number of items in the cart so that even if the user refreshes the page the cart history is still available. I also got to use Bootstrap's modal that I implemented for the lightbox gallery that is only visible on large screens (>992px) on clicking the large product image.
